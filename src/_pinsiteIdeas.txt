- use 
    - semantic html (!)
    - (?) <details>
    - (?) position: sticky
    - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/

- responsive and fluid design 
    - to work on mobile, tablets and desktop using media query
    - mobile first (and probably different desgin, e.g. darker color theme, etc.)
    - use media query, not separate CSS files per media attr
    - Menu
        - Always show it (especially on long pages so user can go up easily)
        - Once scrolled down, shrink it, maybe make it a bit transparent, but on mouse-over no transparency should go away.

- Potential website structure:
    - Home (through navigation link and main logo)
        - Cool picture (maybe slightly moving). Similar to this: https://www.nathanielkoloc.com/
        - large font
          E.g.
           "Hi, I am Pavel
           Frotn End engineer and _anything web_ fan
           from Seattle"
        - Lots of free space (?)
        Use flex
        - Idea for design
            - Start with my large name on top, lost of space, then lower navigation.
            - As user scroll down, name disappears and nav sticks to the top with logo appearing.
            - Nav stays that way on all other pages

    - Playground
        - grid (for list of playground projects ?)
            - perhapse use <figure> for cells in grid?

        - Interesting design
        - "Preloading" of each page before content is loaded.
        - Showing positioning on the page on the left side
